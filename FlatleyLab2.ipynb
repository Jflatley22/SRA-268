While on the other hand, the lower seeded teams have a lot less accumulated points than the higher seeded teams. This could be for multiple reasons such as the higher seeds playing in more games, and the higher seeds being better teams therefore scoring more points. The points on the plot also fade from dark blue to light to show that the darker the dot, the more points that were scored."

The graph manages to fluctuate a lot moving up and down throughout the years, however it manages to stay relatively consistent. Every year is at most within 1,000 points of the last year. While there are many times the graph moves up in down due to the points scored, it manages to stay within that range. The highest the graph hits is the last year that we have records of which is a little over 4,600 points in 2017."

This graph helps compare each team side by side to show which teams overall have scored more points than others. This can be for a variety of reasons including some teams playing in more games than others which therefore makes their point total higher.
